# SCINet:  Sample Convolution and Interaction Networks Implementation (Work in Progress)

This is an implementation of SCINet using tensorflow and a work in progress.
I want to explore the possibility of using SCINet to predict cryptocurrency prices and how they compare to traditional 
approaches such as an ARIMA.

SCINet is a novel architecture for time series forecasting proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09305v1.pdf).
See original paper for link to datasets.
