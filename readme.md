# SCINet Implementation (Work in Progress)

This is implementation of SCINet using tensorflow and a work in progress.
I want to explore the possibility of using SCINet as a ARIMA model to predict cryptocurrency prices.

SCINet is a new architecture for time series forecasting proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09305v1.pdf).
